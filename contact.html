								Tarik is by far one of the best freelancers I have found on Elance. I would 100% strongly recommend him to anyone needing his services. English is great, always seemed to be available when we needed him, and most importantly he stuck with us with excellent professionalism through all of our (many) revisions! His number 1 goal was to make sure we got exactly where we wanted to be. Once again this freelancer is A++ quality.
